# RaspberryPi-Python-PCA9685

Dependencies:
Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library
To install: pip install adafruit-pca9685 (**use only with python3** - **substitute pip3 for pip if necessary**)

This code is used for controlling the Servo Pumpkin with multiple routines. This code can also be applied to other projects that use the PCA9685 PWM controller with a Raspberry Pi to control servos

**added support for adding more servos** - to add and control more eyes on your pumpkin, you will have to add the positions for each routine, but you can pass in as many eyes as you want to the pumpkin class.

The original code to control the pumpkin (Arduino C++) can also be found here: https://github.com/pythoncader/ServoPumpkin
