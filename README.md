# RaspberryPi-Python-PCA9685

Dependencies:
Adafruit PWM Servo Driver Library
To install: pip install adafruit-pca9685 (**use only with python3** - **substitute pip3 for pip if necessary**)

This code is used for controlling the Servo Pumpkin with multiple routines. This code can also be applied to other projects that use the PCA9685 PWM controller with a Raspberry Pi to control servos  
  
C++ version for the Arduino: https://github.com/pythoncader/Arduino-Servo-Class
The original code to control the pumpkin (with Arduino) can also be found here: https://github.com/pythoncader/ServoPumpkin
